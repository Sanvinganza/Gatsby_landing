If you are self-isolating, you must: not leave your home for any reason â€“ if you need food or medicine, order them by phone or online, or ask someone else to drop them off at your home ; not have visitors, such as friends and family, in your home. You can use your garden, if you have one. Any exercise should be taken at home."
